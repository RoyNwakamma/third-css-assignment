            I will dearly miss Steve Jobs he inspired me to keep getting the iphones
            i have loved them ever since the first one. Steve Jobs was a great man 
            and a awesome CEO for APPLE. He has inspired me to one day and go for
            and work with the apple when i get old but my dream is to own Apple and follow
            by Steve Jobs way and make Apple greater than it was. But i will dearly miss 
            Steve Jobs he's a great man and i will never forget him

        <h4>so sad</h4>
        <p>
            As i heard this sad news via my iPhone I am emailing my condolences from my
            MacsBook Pro. Steve has left a fingerprint on our culture that cannot be 
            rivaled and will be long lasting. My deepest sympathy to his family and 
            friends.

        <h4>Steve Jobs</h4>
        <p>What impact has Steve Jobs had on my life? Every short story i've
            written as an adult (and certainly every one that has been published),
            almost every email i've ever written, has been written on machines
            created by Apple. I interacted online using an Apple machine long before
            i ever encountered a PC. Steve Jobs helped to realise the Star Trek 
            future i dreamed of as a kid. And through his vision, i have been able to
            realise my own. You'll be missed, Mr Jobs. Thanks for all your amazing works.

        <h4>He's gone...</h4>
        <p>
            A part of my head was cracked. I didn't know him personally but i felt like 
            i knew him. I will forever remember him. I'm still saddened because he 
            was taken too soon. I can only imagine his struggles. Heaven has certaily 
            gained an angel.

        <p>
            Dear Apple I was deeply saddened to hear about The death of Steve Jobs,
            the great leader and creator in the world. I believe he would go to a 
            more beautiful place and he would like to see a stronger Apple. We will 
            remember him forever.

        <h4>I will always remember Steve!</h4>
        <p>
            Dear Steve's family, dear Apple company I can't find words how to 
            describe my feelings...For me Apple means a lot - I got a good job 
            using Apple products, I have found a new lifestyle thanks to Apple.
            And, of course, I've been always admiring your products. And for me 
            everything in Apple is connected with Steve. I do hope he'll be 
            remembered around the world as a genius.
